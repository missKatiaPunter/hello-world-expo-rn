# My first expo app and notes

`navigator` in `App.js` is a tool from the library [react-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/).

You can use inine css as so:

```js
const ComponentsScreen = () => {
    return <Text style={{fontSize: 70}}>Lalalala! It works</Text>;
};
```

> Inline css does not error if there was a typo. It gives a warning.
